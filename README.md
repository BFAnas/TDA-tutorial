# Tutorial for Topological Data Analysis with the Gudhi Library

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a recent and fast growing  field providing a set of new topological and geometric tools to infer relevant features for possibly complex data. Here we propose a set of notebooks for the practice of TDA with the python Gudhi library together with popular machine learning and data sciences libraries.


See for instance [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04019) for an introduction TDA for data sciences
