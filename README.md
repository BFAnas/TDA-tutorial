# Tutorial for Topological Data Analysis with the Gudhi Library

Topological Data Analysis (tda) is a recent and fast growing  eld providing a set of new topological and geometric tools to infer relevant features for possibly complex data. This paper is a brief introduction, through a few selected topics, to basic fundamental and practical aspects of tda for non experts.

See for instance [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04019) for an introduction TDA for data sciences


1 - Simplex trees and simpicial complexes


2 - Persitence homology and metrics


3 - alternative representation of persistence and linearization


4 - Statistical tools for persistence


5 - Machine learning and Deep learning for persistence


6- Alternative filtration and robust TDA


7- Topological Data Analysis and Time series
